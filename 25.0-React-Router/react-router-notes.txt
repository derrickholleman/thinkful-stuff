React Router initial takeaways

Links to routes are made with <Link> tags and are created dynamically by mapping the data's ID to a URL that matches with a Route and usually between the link tags is a name that came from within the data object. <Link to={`${url}/posts`}>Posts</Link>

Components are wrapped in <Switch> & <Route> tags and you specify which URL the Component will be rendered at.  Ex. <Route exact path='/users/:userId'>  

useRouteMatch() gets the ID the component is rendered at and can be stored in a variable like const {url} = useRouteMatch()

useParams() gets the params from the URL and can be stored in a variable.  For example a route with the URL /users/2, could be stored in const {userId} = useParams(), with userId equalling 2.
