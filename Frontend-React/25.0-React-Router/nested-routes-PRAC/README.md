# Nested Routes

Add any necessary nested routes to the `<User />` and `<UserPosts />` components.
Also update any links to make sure they use the URL from the nearest parent `Route`.

No need to change `<App />`, `<Users />` or  `<UserProfile />`

Use this starter code for the application. You will, of course, need to add appropriate logic to make the application work.
